# mdnet-pytorch
PyTorch implementation of the [MDNet tracker](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/research/mdnet/).

**Note:** the functions and classes are almost directly copied from the official repository [py-MDNet](https://github.com/HyeonseobNam/py-MDNet). Except that for easy of reproduction, I have made all code in one file.

Install `PyTorch` and `scipy`, then run MDNet tracker with the following command:

```
python run_tracker.py
```

There's already a sample sequence in the data folder.
